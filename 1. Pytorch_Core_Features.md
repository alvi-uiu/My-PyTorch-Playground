1. **Tensor Computations** – PyTorch uses tensors, which are similar to NumPy arrays but can run on GPUs for faster computation.

2. **GPU Acceleration** – PyTorch can use GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) to speed up deep learning tasks.

3. **Dynamic Computation Graph** – Unlike static graphs (e.g., in TensorFlow 1.x), PyTorch builds computation graphs dynamically, making it easier to debug and modify.

4. **Automatic Differentiation** – PyTorch provides automatic differentiation (Autograd), which helps compute gradients easily for optimization.

5. **Distributed Training** – It supports training models across multiple GPUs and even multiple machines for faster processing.

6. **Interoperability with Other Libraries** – PyTorch works well with NumPy and other machine learning libraries, making it flexible for different applications.
